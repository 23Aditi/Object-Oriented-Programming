# Java Viva Questions - Classes, Objects, Constructors & Copy Constructor

## 1. Basic Concepts of Classes and Objects
### Q1: What is a class in Java?
**Answer:** A class in Java is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

### Q2: What is an object in Java?
**Answer:** An object is an instance of a class. It is created using the `new` keyword and represents a real-world entity with specific values assigned to the properties defined in the class.

### Q3: What are the basic components of a class?
**Answer:** A class in Java typically consists of:
- **Fields (attributes)**: Variables that hold the data for the object.
- **Methods**: Functions that define the behavior of the object.
- **Constructors**: Special methods used to initialize the object.

### Q4: What is the role of a constructor in Java?
**Answer:** A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It is called automatically when an object of the class is created. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

### Q5: What is the difference between a default constructor and a parameterized constructor?
**Answer:** 
- **Default Constructor**: A constructor that does not take any parameters and initializes the object with default values.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: A constructor that takes parameters to initialize an object with specific values.

## 2. Working with Objects and Constructors
### Q1: How do you create an object of a class in Java?
**Answer:** You create an object using the `new` keyword, followed by the class constructor. For example:
```java
Complex c1 = new Complex(3, 4);
```

### Q2: Can a class have multiple constructors?
**Answer:** Yes, a class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists. This is called **constructor overloading**.

### Q3: What is method overloading in Java?
**Answer:** Method overloading occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameter lists (either in the number or type of parameters).

### Q4: What will happen if you don’t define a constructor in a class?
**Answer:** If no constructor is defined, Java provides a **default constructor** that initializes the object with default values (e.g., `0` for integers, `null` for objects).

## 3. Understanding the Copy Constructor
### Q1: What is a copy constructor in Java?
**Answer:** A copy constructor is a special constructor used to create a new object by copying the values from an existing object of the same class.

### Q2: Why do we need a copy constructor?
**Answer:** A copy constructor is necessary when we need to create a copy of an object with the same values as the original object. It ensures that the new object has the same state as the original object.

### Q3: Can you demonstrate the use of a copy constructor in your `Complex` class?
**Answer:** Yes, here is the copy constructor:
```java
public Complex(Complex c) {
    this.real = c.real;
    this.img = c.img;
}
```
This constructor creates a new `Complex` object by copying the `real` and `img` values from another `Complex` object `c`.

### Q4: What is the difference between a copy constructor and the `clone()` method?
**Answer:**
- **Copy Constructor**: Explicitly copies the values from one object to another by calling the constructor.
- **`clone()` Method**: A method that creates a duplicate of an object, but it requires the class to implement the `Cloneable` interface and override the `clone()` method.

### Q5: How does a copy constructor work in Java?
**Answer:** The copy constructor takes an object of the same class as a parameter and copies its data members into the new object. This creates a new object with the same values as the original object.

### Q6: Can you use a copy constructor for deep copying?
**Answer:** Yes, a copy constructor can be used for deep copying if the object contains references to other objects. In that case, you would need to copy the referenced objects, not just the primitive data members.

### Q7: Can the copy constructor be used to pass objects to a method without affecting the original object?
**Answer:** Yes, by using the copy constructor, you can create a new object with the same values as the original one and pass this copy to a method. This ensures the original object remains unaffected.

## 4. Practical Scenarios and Code-related Questions
### Q1: What will happen if you don't implement a copy constructor and try to pass an object of the same class to a method?
**Answer:** If you don’t implement a copy constructor, Java will pass the object by reference. Any changes made to the object inside the method will affect the original object because both variables point to the same memory location.

### Q2: How would you modify your code to ensure that two objects of the `Complex` class are independent of each other?
**Answer:** You can modify the code to use a copy constructor to create a new `Complex` object with the same values as the original, ensuring that changes to one object do not affect the other.

### Q3: What are some common mistakes when implementing a copy constructor?
**Answer:**
- **Not copying mutable objects correctly**: If the class contains references to other objects, the copy constructor should ensure a deep copy of those objects.
- **Incorrect field assignments**: Ensure that all fields are copied correctly, especially in the case of complex objects.

### Q4: What is the output of the following code if you use the copy constructor?
```java
Complex c1 = new Complex(3, 4);
Complex c2 = new Complex(c1);
c2.display();  // What will be the output?
```
**Answer:** The output will be `3.0 + 4.0i`, as `c2` is created as a copy of `c1`.

## 5. Advanced Questions
### Q1: What is the role of `this` keyword in constructors?
**Answer:** The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object. In a constructor, it is used to differentiate between the instance variables and the constructor parameters if they have the same name.

### Q2: What is the impact of using a copy constructor with immutable objects?
**Answer:** For immutable objects, a copy constructor is not necessary because the objects cannot be modified once created. Copying them does not change their state.

### Q3: What happens when an object is passed by value versus passed by reference?
**Answer:** 
- **By Value**: A copy of the object is passed, meaning changes to the object inside the method will not affect the original object.
- **By Reference**: The original object is passed, and any changes made to the object inside the method will affect the original object.

## Conclusion
In this section, we covered fundamental concepts related to classes, objects, constructors, and the copy constructor in Java. These concepts form the backbone of object-oriented programming and are essential to understand when designing classes and managing object creation in Java.
